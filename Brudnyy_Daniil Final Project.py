Description:
This program analyzes nuclear explosion data for over forty years. It takes a dataset showing the nuclear explosions from the very first one in 1945 to 1998. There have been numerous explosions since then and other countries not in the dataset have acquired nuclear weapons, but this code is meant to handle possible additions to the CSV data file. The charts and tables show the distribution of weapons by country and year, allowing a user to properly analyze which country had the most deployments, what year had the most deployments, and a map showing where the deployments happened. If a user wishes to check the name of a warhead, they can do so on the Data Properties page. There are numerous other features to the page, but the best way to discover all of them is by browsing through the various sections of this website.
